## ~/.local/share/fonts

The fonts you'll find here are some of the custom stuff I used that I've accumulated from various sources, and so this place serves as a common reserve for sorts...
#
Whilst programming, I normally use the Nerd-Font variants of **FiraCode** and **Hack**, both of which can be downloaded from https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads</br></br>
And.. I use [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto) as my main system font

To list all the available fonts on your system, do:
```sh
fc-list
```
